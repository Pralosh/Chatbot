*** To Run the Program Following Steps are required ***

1=> The host computer needs to have Node.js Installed

2=> The dependencies used in the program should also be installed. To install the dependencies follow the steps below:

    => npm init -y
    => npm install express multer nedb fs crypto path

=> With the dependencies installed, open the terminal in your IDE and type 'node index.js' to run the localhost server. For this program,
   the server is running on port:5000

=> To give commands to the chatbot, there are predefined keywords:

    => Try using : "hi" as your greeting
    => Then: "search for dummy5.pdf(the file you uploaded with extension)"

    => This will search the database for the file and download it automatically(if file exists) to your PC.

** If the program does not work, please delete the node_modules folder and try checking if the PC has Node.js correctly installed,
   and follow the Step-2 again.
